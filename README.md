# Abandoned
I have abandoned this build in favor of <https://github.com/c1im4cu5/0xcarbon_Desktop_Trading_App> - An 0xcarbon enabled Desktop Trading App.

## DemExchange-Websocket
Order Subscription Python Websocket for <https://app.dem.exchange> - IBC Enabled Blockchain App for 0xcarbon

Websocket is currently being designed to operate in conjunction with the Carbon SDK.

## Goals
- [x] Stable Pair Grid/Ping Pong Trading Bot (WBTC-BTCB, BUSD-USDC)
- [ ] On-Exchange Arbitrage

## Examples
Please see the examples folder for more information on enacting a TS websocket or a Python websocket to 0xcarbon blockchain with order generation options.
